            <h2>Lionel Messi</h2>
            <p>
                Lionel Andrés Messi[note 1] (Spanish pronunciation:
                [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi] (About this soundlisten);[A]
                also known as Leo Messi,[8] (born 24 June 1987) is an
                Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward
                and captains both Spanish club Barcelona and the Argentina
                national team. Often considered the best player in the
                world and widely regarded as one of the greatest players of
                all time, Messi has won a record six Ballon d'Or awards,
                [note 2] a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020
                was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team. He has spent his
                entire professional career with Barcelona, where he has
                won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles,
                seven Copa del Rey titles and four UEFA Champions Leagues.
                A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds
                the records for most goals in La Liga (474), a La Liga and
                European league season (50), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36)
                and the UEFA Champions League (8), and most assists in La Liga
                (192), a La Liga and European league season (21)[11] and the
                Copa América (13). He has scored over 750 senior career goals
                for club and country, and has the most goals ever by a player
                for a single club.

            <h2>Lionel Messi's Early Life</h2>
            <p>
                Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, the third of four
                children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife
                Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop.
                On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the
                great-grandson of immigrants from the northcentral Adriatic Marche
                region of Italy and Catalonia, and on his mother's side, he has
                primarily Italian ancestry.[5][14] Growing up in a tight-knit,
                football-loving family, "Leo" developed a passion for the sport
                from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers,
                Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel
                Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers.[15]
                At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was
                coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player
                came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him
                to training and matches.[16] He was greatly affected by her death,
                shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Catholic,
                he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky
                in tribute to his grandmother.

            <h2>Barcelona</h2>
            <p>
                During the 2003–04 season, his fourth with Barcelona, Messi
                rapidly progressed through the club's ranks, debuting for a
                record five youth teams in a single campaign.[35] After being
                named player of the tournament in four international pre-season
                competitions with the Juveniles B, he played only one official
                match with the team before being promoted to the Juveniles A,
                where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games.[36][37] Messi
                was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen
                a depleted first team during the international break. French
                winger Ludovic Giuly explained how a teenage Leo caught the
                eye in a training session with Frank Rijkaard's first team:
                "He destroyed us all... They were kicking him all over the place
                to avoid being ridiculed by this kid, he just got up and kept on
                playing. He would dribble past four players and score a goal. Even
                the team's starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an alien."

            <h2>Success at youth level</h2>
            <p>
                As a dual Argentine-Spanish national, Messi was eligible
                to play for the national team of both countries.[321]
                Selectors for Spain's Under-17 squad began pursuing him in
                2003 after Barcelona's director of football, Carles Rexach,
                alerted the Royal Spanish Football Federation to their young
                player. Messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent
                La Albiceleste since childhood. To further prevent Spain from
                taking him, the Argentine Football Association organised two
                under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay,
                with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player
                in FIFA. Five days after his 17th birthday, on 29 June, he made
                his debut for his country against Paraguay, scoring once and
                providing two assists in their 8–0 victory. He was subsequently
                included in the squad for the South American Youth Championship,
                held in Colombia in February 2005. As he lacked the stamina of
                his teammates, the result of his former growth hormone deficiency,
                he was used as a substitute in six of the nine games. After being
                named man of the match against Venezuela, he scored the winning 2–1
                goal in the crucial last match against Brazil, thereby securing
                their third-place qualification for the FIFA World Youth Championship.

            <h2>Career achievements by Lionel Messi</h2>
            <p>
                Argentinian footballer Lionel Messi, regarded by many
                as the greatest player of all time, has received six
                Ballon d'Or awards, the most for any football player, as
                well as the 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year and 2019
                The Best FIFA Men's Player. Messi holds the record for most
                goals in La Liga (474), the Supercopa de España (14), the
                UEFA Super Cup (3) and is the player with the most official
                recorded assists in football history (311).[5][6] He has scored
                774 goals for club and country throughout his professional career
                and is also the first player in history to win five and six European
                Golden Shoes.He has spent his entire professional career with
                Barcelona, where he has won a club-record 34 trophies, including
                ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and four UEFA Champions Leagues.
                Messi was named football's GOAT by the NFL on the basis that he's won the
                Champions League four times and that is exactly what has stirred controversy.
